    <p>Hello all, I’m Tom and I specialise in building fast, scalable, responsive front-ends (<strong><abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr></strong> / <strong><abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr></strong> / <strong><abbr title="Javascript">JS</abbr></strong>) and implementing these front-end templates into fully bespoke WordPress themes (I also specialise in and know my way around a lot of other CMS theming such as Shopify, Big Cartel, Jekyll, Ghost etc.)</p>

    <p>There's nothing I love more than developing responsive websites, making them as performant as I can and testing in as many browsers / devices I have at my disposal, I then move on to making the content management a breeze. In short: I make sure as many users as possible will have an awesome user experience browsing the site.</p>

    <p>If you are interested in working with me on a project, I am available for freelance work so don’t hesitate to <a href="/contact">get in touch with me</a> so we can get the ball rolling.</p>
