excerpt:  "I decided the site needed a complete overhaul, design and content wise because I just didn’t feel motivated enough to maintain the old version, now it’s back with a fresh design and maintainability workflow"

{{ page.excerpt }}.

Not only is the design different, the way I maintain it is. Instead of running the site on WordPress (overkill for what I need, there’s way to much stuff (awesome stuff, granted) packed into WordPress that I just didn’t use it which made the site feel very cluttered and slow to me). The site now runs on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), a simple, blog aware, static site generator which I have fallen in love with. The site also takes advantage of the awesome framework [inuit.css](http://inuitcss.com) (not usually a fan of frameworks but this one’s different, honest), I couldn’t recommend it more.

With any new site there’s bound to be bugs hidden away (there shouldn’t be because I’ve tested this site to no end), so if you spot any I would really appreciate it if you [let me know](/contact).
