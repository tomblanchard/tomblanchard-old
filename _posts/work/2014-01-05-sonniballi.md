{{ page.excerpt }}

This project was somewhat different to the usual WordPress websites I develop, it is built on a full-screen content slider framework so each blog post or video post is within a slide which you can use the arrows to navigate through. This website is fully responsive so it looks fine and functions beautifully on any size device, I also had to put a lot of work in to make this website look good on Javascript-disabled browsers.
