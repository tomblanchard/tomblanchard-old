excerpt:  "I was approached by interface designer [Derek Bender](http://derekbender.com) to be part of the [Jack + Mulligan](http://jackandmulligan.com) e-commerce site redesign. My role in the project was building all front-end templates from visuals designed by Derek and then authoring a completely custom, from-scratch Shopify theme from them. It was my first ever experience with Shopify and I instantly fell in love with it, the theme API is awesome."

{{ page.excerpt }}

The most fun I had with this project was building the store mini cart (the component at the top right of the site). It's powered by AJAX, which wasn't in the original brief, I did it this way to make the experience smoother, who wants a full page reload just to remove an item from their cart? When Javascript fails, the mini cart degrades gracefully and still functions as it should.
