excerpt:  "[David Zinyama](http://davidzinyama.com) approached me with four Photoshop website design image files and a very detailed list of how every site module should function. The site is built in WordPress which is a bloggerâ€™s best friend and is completely responsive, the posts are also displayed in a dynamic grid layout which I achieved using the [jQuery Masonry](http://masonry.desandro.com) plugin."

Styled By Who started out as a simple blog back in 2011, founded by Ashley Blizzard, but since then has expanded into a full on digital magazine focussing on fashion and styling. Ashley noticed a much higher demand for her advice which resulted in her needing a new site.
