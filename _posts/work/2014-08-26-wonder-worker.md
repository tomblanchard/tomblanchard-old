excerpt:  "This was a nice little project to work on which involved teaming up with designer [Pedro Marques](http://aysedesignz.com) to build a new site for the Wonder Worker Denim Laboratory, an alternative denim apparel company. I handled the entire front-end build of the site, then went on to implement the front-end templates into a bespoke WordPress theme."

{{ page.excerpt }}

As this site includes a lot of photos to showcase the apparel lookbooks I thought it was a no-brainer to take advantage of new responsive images solutions so the site is as fast as possible in every environment. One of my favorite things about WordPress is how you can set various images sizes and upload an image and it will generate the same image but in all the various sizes you specify. All I had to do then is use the new responsive images markup `srcset` and `sizes` to serve up the correct images for the correct environment. I'm very pleased with the outcome of this.
