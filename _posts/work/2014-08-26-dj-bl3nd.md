{{ page.excerpt }}

Pedro provided me with all site visuals and explanations of how each component should function, from there I began the responsive, mobile first front-end build process of the project. This part included quite a lot of revisions and fine tuning to get it just right, but we got there in the end. The biggest challenge I faced here was keeping the home page as lightweight as possible which was a challenge considering the amount of content and media there (various content sliders, music players, external API content etc.)

Once the front-end templates were done I got to work with building a bespoke WordPress theme from them. I made the WordPress dashboard very easy to use and simple to add certain content with custom post types, custom fields, a simple theme customizer etc. Overall I couldn't be happier with how the project turned out.
