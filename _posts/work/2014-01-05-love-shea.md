Love Shea is an online store connected to [ATFierce](http://atfierce.com) (also developed by me) which specialises in natural beauty products for both women and men. The client himself ([Abraham Tomo Jr.](http://linkedin.com/in/atomojr)) actually designed the templates for the site.

I was provided with five Photoshop website design image files which I analysed and coded up to static HTML5/CSS3 templates as efficiently as possible. I then proceeded to convert the static templates to a fully functional Big Cartel theme bespoke to Abraham’s needs (AJAX add to cart etc.)
